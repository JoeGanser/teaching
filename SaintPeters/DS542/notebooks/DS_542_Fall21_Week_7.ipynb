      "that youâve had.â\r\n",

      "person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of\r\n",
      "being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild,\r\n",

      "some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on\r\n",
      "the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least\r\n",
      "the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and\r\n",
      "marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of\r\n",
      "infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I\r\n",

      "on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted\r\n",

      "wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the\r\n",

      "exempt from my reactionâGatsby, who represented everything for which I\r\n",

      "successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some\r\n",
      "heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related\r\n",
      "to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten\r\n",

      "romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and\r\n",
      "which it is not likely I shall ever find again. NoâGatsby turned out\r\n",
      "all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust\r\n",

      "and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for\r\n",

      "supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established\r\n",
      "dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning\r\n",
      "aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding\r\n",
      "clothes could hide the enormous power of that bodyâhe seemed to fill\r\n",
      "those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could\r\n",
      "see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his\r\n",
      "thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverageâa cruel body.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of\r\n",
      "fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I\r\n",

      "played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,\r\n",
      "bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement\r\n",
